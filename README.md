# Week 3 Comprehensive Assessment

Fork this repository, update this file to include your answers, and submit a pull request. You may refer to any notes, past projects, or external resources you want. The questions do not have to be completed in order.

### Models

1. I'm creating an app to keep track of bunnies. I already have a `bunnies` table, but I want to create a migration to add a "weight" column to it. What command should I run in my terminal to get started?

rails generate migration AddWeightOnBunnies

2. I just realized I misspelled the "weight" column in my migration, but I already ran `rake db:migrate`. What should I do to fix this? (give exact steps and/or commands to run)

Rollback the migration, fix the spelling error, re-run the migration.
$ rake db:rollback
---Fix spelling error--
$ rake db:migrate

3. My app has a `Bunny` model, and I want to find bunnies whose `color` attribute is `'white'`, sorted by their `name` attribute. What code should I write to do that?

Bunny.find_by(color: 'white').order(:name)

4. Now I want to find the specific bunny whose name is `'George'` (names are unique, so there should be only one).

Bunny.where(name: "George")

5. I want to make sure nobunny, er, I mean nobody, can create a bunny without a name. What code should I add to my `Bunny` model to validate this?

validates :name, presence: true

### Controllers

1. My app is telling me there's an error in the `BunniesController`. What directory and filename should I look in?

app-controllers-bunnies_controller.rb

2. I'm in the `show` action of my `BunniesController` and I have the ID of a specific bunny in `params[:id]`. What line should I type to find the bunny with the correct ID, and assign it to a variable that my view can access?

@bunny = Bunny.find(params[:id])


3. I tried to update a bunny with the code `bunny.update(params[:bunny])`, but it gave me a "forbidden attributes error". Why is it telling me this, and what should I do (broadly speaking, no exact code needed) to fix the problem?

You have to specifically allow updating that attribute by creating a bunny_param method in the bunnies_controller, otherwise strong params does not allow updating it.

4. When I create or update a bunny in my controller, how can I find out whether the bunny saved successfully?

In the console type Bunny.saved, which will return true or false

5. Assuming my bunny saved successfully, what code should I write to redirect the user to the "show" page for the bunny, with a flash message indicating success?

if @bunny.save
      redirect_to bunnies_path

### Routes/Views

1. What line should I add to `config/routes.rb` to create a complete set of RESTful routes for a "bunnies" resource?

resources :bunnies

2. My app is telling me there's an error in the "show" view for bunnies. What directory and filename would that be located in?

app-views-bunnies-how.html.erb

3. I'm in the `index.html.erb` view and I've assigned a variable `@bunnies` to a collection of all my bunnies. What HTML/ERB code should I write to create an unordered list that shows each bunny's `name` attribute?

<ul>
<% @bunnies.each do |bunnies| %>
<%= bunnies.name %>
<% end %>
</ul>

4. In one of my views, I want to create a link to the "show" path for a specific bunny that I have stored in the variable `bunny`. `rake routes` tells me that I have a standard `bunny_path` helper available. How do I create this link?

:(

5. I've created a view partial called `_form.html.erb` and I want to render this partial into my "new" view. What HTML/ERB code should I write to do this?

<%= render partial: "form", bunny: @bunny %>
